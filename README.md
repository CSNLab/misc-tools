# Miscellaneous Tools
This repository contains some miscellaneous small utility Python scripts that may make your life easier.

See the docstring at the beginning of each file for detailed description, usage, examples, etc.

## Contents
### `data_conversion_util.py`
A few functions to convert data files between json, csv and python dictionary/list, or wide and long format.

### `trigger_sender.py`
Automatically send triggers by generating keyboard presses (so you can test an fMRI task script without an MRI scanner).

### `organize_as_BIDS.py`
Renames and reorganizes the fMRI data into the [Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644).

### `neuro_data_snippets/suma_prep.sh` and `neuro_data_snippets/create_masks.py`
These two files help create ROI masks in native space, given data preprocessed by FMRIPREP/FreeSurfer.
